**1.1. Installation of be-BOP**

- **Prerequisites:**

    1. **Technical Infrastructure:**

        - **S3-Compatible Storage:** A service or solution (e.g., MinIO, AWS S3, Scaleway, etc.) with bucket configuration (S3_BUCKET, S3_ENDPOINT_URL, S3_KEY_ID, S3_KEY_SECRET, S3_REGION).

        - **MongoDB Database in ReplicaSet:** Either a local instance configured as a ReplicaSet or a service like MongoDB Atlas (variables MONGODB_URL and MONGODB_DB).

        - **Node.js Environment:** Node version 18 or higher, with Corepack enabled (`corepack enable`).

        - **Git LFS Installed:** To manage large files (command `git lfs install`).

    2. **Communication Configuration:**

        - **SMTP:** Valid SMTP credentials (SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASSWORD, SMTP_FROM) for sending emails and notifications.

    3. **Security and Notifications (at least one of the following):**

        - **Email:** An email account allowing SMTP configuration for sending notifications.

        - **Nostr Key (nsec):** An NSEC key (can be generated by be-BOP via the Nostr interface).

    5. **Knowledge of Your VAT Regime:**

        - It is essential to know the VAT regime applicable to your business (e.g., sales under the seller’s country VAT, exemption with justification, or sales at the buyer’s country VAT rate) to correctly configure billing and VAT calculation options in be-BOP.

    6. **Currency Configuration:**

        - Clearly determine the primary currency to use, the secondary currency (if applicable), and, for a 100% BTC store, the reference currency for accounting.

    7. **Other Business Prerequisites:**

        - Have a clear vision of your order processes, inventory management, shipping fee policies, and payment and collection methods, both online and in-store.

        - Know the legal obligations (legal notices, terms of use, privacy policy) for setting up mandatory CMS pages.

- **Installation:** Deploy the application using the official installation script on your server and ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.

**1.2. Creating the Super-Admin Account**

- Go to **/admin/login**.

- Create your super-admin account by choosing a secure username and password. Prefer a passphrase of three or more words.

- This account will grant access to all back-office functionalities.

# 2. Securing and Configuring the Back-Office

**2.1. Securing Access**

- **Configuring the Access Hash:**

    - Navigate to **/admin/config** via the admin interface.

    - In the section dedicated to security (e.g., “Admin hash”), set a unique string (hash).

    - Once saved, the back-office URL will change (e.g., **/admin-yourhash/login**) to restrict access to authorized users.

**2.2. Enabling Maintenance Mode (if needed)**

- In **/admin/config** (Config > Config via the graphical interface), check the **Enable maintenance mode** option at the bottom of the page.

- Optionally, specify a list of authorized IPv4 addresses (comma-separated) to allow front-office access during maintenance.

- The back-office remains accessible to administrators.

**2.3. Configuring Recovery Access via Email or Nostr**

- In **/admin/config**, via the ARM module, ensure the super-admin account includes a recovery email address or npub to facilitate password recovery.

**2.4. Configuring Language or Multilingual Settings**

- In **Admin > Config > Languages**, enable or disable the language selector depending on whether your site is multilingual or single-language (disable it for a single-language site).

**2.5. Configuring Layout, Logos, and Favicon**

- In **Admin > Merch > Layout**, configure the top bar, navbar, and footer.

    - Ensure the “Display powered by be-BOP” option is enabled in the footer.
